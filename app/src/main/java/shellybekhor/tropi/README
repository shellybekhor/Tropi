 The Vision
=============

As four plants lover students we spoke about how sad it is to
lose a loved plant for bad treatment. We decided to fight it by
creating an app handling our plants watering routine: TROPI.

Tropi is enabling saving new plants we adopt to our home, finding
their category and following that to remind the user when to
water the plants by categories.

It avoids plants dehydration or over-hydration in order to extend
their lives. By following the app and checking all the watering
"to do" check boxes, the user will be able to enlarge his plant
collection into his mini-jungle dream of healthy beautiful plants.

 About The App
================

The app UI was intended to be fun and colorful in order to create
an engagement of the user and encourage him to update the app with
every new plant he adopts and follow the treatment instructions.

Every plant in the app is identified by it's category, and therefore
the correct watering routine, and the plant icon that can be chosen
from multiple icons.

The app main screen holds a 'to do' check box with the watering
tasks for the current day.


=========
 Design
=========

(*) We have 4 plants classes, one base class and three inheriting ones.
Each inheriting class in defining the correct traetement for that
specific plant type:

Plant (abstract base class)
    Succulents
    Spices
    Tropic

(*) The user plants data is saved into a firebase DB holding the user
details, plants categories, icons and last watering date.
